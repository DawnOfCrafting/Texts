I owe him my life." = "在沙之地生存本身已经很难了, 在穴居人占领我们的地方后就更难了.我最先失去了双亲随后就是整个部族.好消息是我一路追踪穴居人回到了他们的不足.这个穴居人小孩(索坤) 一直再帮我.我欠他一条命.";

"Sokuns dad couldn't harbor me anymore so they finally banished me. I knew it was bound to happen sooner or later. I ventured the lands all by myself until I ran into a group of Sapiens. They are very nice people & are also looking to settle down somewhere. I'm happy to help them find a good location." = "索坤的爸爸没有办法再奴役我了, 于是他们就把我放逐出去.我早就知道这迟早会发生.我自己一个人四处游荡随后就组建了一个智人团队.他们人都很好, 也想找一个地方定居.我很开心能帮他们找到一个好的地方.";

There is also a nearby Erectus camp. I'm hoping we can live without any conflicts." = "很难相信这群人能够赶跑穴居人占领他们的地方.我既不强壮也不够聪明能找到更好的地方.很多人也因此丧命.附近也有一个直立人村落.我希望我们能够和平地交流下去.";

"A few months ago, while out gathering berries I ran into an Erectus girl from the nearby camp. Margira is the most beautiful creature I have ever seen. But due to our situation we always meet in secret. I just learned that her dream is also to build a multi race village." = "几个月前我在采莓果时遇到了一个直立人女孩, 她是从附近的村落来的.马格里拉是我见到过的最美丽的人.不过那时的情况我们还是需要私下见面.我意识到她想建造一个多种族共存的村庄.";

"We got ambushed by the Neanderthals, the same ones that we kicked out from this location. Some how their numbers have increased I don't even know how I got out. I lost most of my Sapien friends during the ambush. I've been trying for weeks now and I can't even get close to Margira. All of these lands are tensed with feud." = "我们被穴居人袭击后又被赶出了这片区域.不知怎么他们的人数就越发壮大了起来.在袭击时我很多智人朋友都走了.这几周我一直在想办法还是没有机会接近马格里拉.所有的地方都纷争不断.";

I started calling him Minion and he seems to be okay with it." = "在独自一人旅行一段时间后我遇到了这个有趣的小家伙.虽然他不会说话, 不过他擅长取东西, 而且真的超好玩.我于是就叫他仆人, 他似乎对此也无所谓.";

"These last 2 years I was able to travel far with the help of Minion. I met lots of people, lots of races and saw lots of conflicts & battles. I've heard multiple times in multiple places that Master Crafters had singlehandedly changed the outcome of battles. I need to figure out who and what these Master Crafters are if I want to see Margira again." = "在仆人的帮助下我又继续旅行了 2 年.在此期间我结识了许多人, 许多种族, 也见证了许多争斗.我到处都有听闻工匠大师独自一人就能改变战局的传说.我如果想要与马格里拉重逢就要搞清楚工匠大师究竟是什么人.";

"During my journey I visited the Land of Clay, Land of Forest, Land of Flint and met 2 Master Crafters. I studied under them and now I've finally made it to the Crafters Village. This place is like a dream land. Everyone is trying to find more recipes & unlock the hidden secrets of this world. Everyday there is new excitement." = "在旅途之中我造访了黏土之地, 森林之地, 燧石之地, 在那里我认识了 2 名工匠大师.我在他们门下学习, 终于得以踏入工匠之村.那里真的是我梦中的地方.每个人都在寻求更多的配方, 探寻这个世界的秘密.每天都是一场新的挑战.";

"These 5 years were the best years of my life. I reunited with Sokun, the Neanderthal boy who saved me 20 years ago. He isn't as talented as I am but we've both managed to become Master Crafters. We've been hanging out with Trabula (another Sapien) & Moduna (an Erectus), crafting stuff together & having fun. Though I do wonder about Margira occasionally." = "在那里的 5 年可谓是我生命中最好的时间.我又与索坤重逢, 就是 20 年前救过我的穴居人小孩.他虽然不像我这样有天分, 不过我们最终还是都成为了工匠大师.我们还与塔布拉(一名智人)和摩杜纳(一名直立人)一起学习, 打造物品.我还是偶尔会想起马格里拉.";

"The thought of not being with her became intense so I went back to her village and stole her away. With my new skills no one was able to stop me. Now we have settled north in the Land of Stone. My life is so peacefull now, with Margira & my best friend Minion who never left my side." = "我还是克制不住内心思念她的思绪, 最后回到了她的村庄与她私奔.这次可没有人能够拦下身负技能的我了.我们最终在岩石之地定居下来.我和马格里拉还有从未离开我们身边的仆人一起在那里平静地生活.";

"Margira just gave birth to the cutest kid ever, we named him Itaku. He mostly looks like his mom but seems to have my hands. People who have heard a Master Crafter was here have started settling near us. It's weird how quickly word gets around." = "马格里拉还产下了一个超级可爱的小孩, 我们给他起名为依塔库.他长得十分像他妈妈, 不过手却像我.人们在听说这里有一位工匠大师定居后也纷纷向我们这里靠拢.不知不觉就说了这么多.";

"The settlement is now 25 people. We have people from races ranging from Erectus to Neanderthals to some weird looking humans whom we don't know what to call. We even have a few Minions. Such a lovely place." = "聚居地目前有 25 人了.我们这里不仅仅有智人, 穴居人更与一些我们也不知道是什么的人种.我们还有好多仆人.那里超级好的.";

"Minion just had a child. Its fun seeing Itaku play with Minion Junior. Though the settlement is now 50 people and I have a lot of work to do." = "仆人也有也一个小孩.看到依塔库和小仆人一起玩超级有趣.虽然聚居地已经有 50 个人了, 不过我还是有许多事情牙欧洲哦.";

"The settlement is getting bigger but so are the problems. We mostly recieved banished & runaways so ocassionally their families come to request their Kin. I don't even know what to do in most of these situations. But I have to find a way, everyone looks up to me." = "随着聚居地逐渐壮大, 一些问题也因此而来.我们对于被放逐和逃跑的人来者不拒, 所以有时他们原有的部族也会追逐而来.这种情况下我并不知道该如何处理.不过我必须做出决定, 大家可都是在看着我呢.";

"Worst day of my life. We got attacked by multiple villages cooperating. Their goals were to kill the runaways and the interbreeds. The love of my life Margira died trying to save Itaku & Itaku blamed me and ran off." = "那是我生命中最差的一天.那时我们被许多村庄联合起来围攻.他们的目标就是杀死逃跑者和那些混血的人.我的挚爱马格里拉在拯救依塔库时不幸去世, 他责怪于我也跑掉了.";

"Itaku took refugee at the Erectus camp. He won't leave no matter what I say, he is still pissed about his mom passing away. I also can't take him by force because of all my injuries. At least they think he is a full blood Erectus that way he won't have trouble living there." = "他跑到了直立人的村落.无论我怎样劝说他都置之不理, 对他妈妈的去世耿耿于怀.我那时也身负重伤无法追回他.至少他们认为他是一个纯血的直立人所以他在那里也不会有问题.";

"It has been 5 years since that day and Itaku still hates me. He is all grown up and doesn't even need my protection anymore. I just lost my best friend Minion due to a sickness. Now all I have left is Minion Junior. He is funny and all but still a kid, I feel so alone." = "自那时起已经过了 5 年, 依塔库还是对我恨之入骨.他已经长大成人不需要我的援助了.我的仆人也因病去世, 我失去了最好的朋友.现在我只剩下小仆人了.他虽然还是个孩子不过超级有趣, 我却倍感孤独.";

"I recently stumbled into a young Sapien caught in an Erectus trap. He has a different look in his eye. He reminds me of my days from the Crafters Village. Life is exciting for me again, I'm curious on how far he will take crafting." = "我最近听说直立人抓到了一个年轻的智人.他神色就与常人有异常.看到他我就想起了自己在工匠之村的日子.我的生活又迸发了色彩, 很好奇他能在工艺之路上能走多远.";

"He spends most of his time alone up in the trees often crying to himself. He sometimes sees other Sapiens, Erectus or Neanderthal all hanging out happily with their family but all he gets is teases." = "他经常独自一人坐在树上哭泣.他时常会看到智人, 直立人和穴居人都和自己的亲族一起快乐的生活, 每当这时他都会伤心.";
"The jokes intensify. Since he is spending all day alone in the trees, his siblings joke about his monkey friends and imitate him. Then he gradually starts acting like a monkey doing goofy moves and talking about his imaginary monkey friends." = "这个玩笑开得太严重了.他流连于树木之间, 他的亲朋好友也因此嘲笑他是猴子.于是它逐渐就类似猴子一样活动, 不断和虚构的猴子朋友交流.";

"A rich fellow invites him to humour his ill son thinking Jokar may be the only one to cheer him up while he gives his last breath. Jokar does as he is purposed and the eldest son of the rich fellow dies smiling. The whole family cries & hugs Jokar because of how happy he sent the son to the heavens. Jokar decides to share this with the world. So he leaves his family to travel." = "有一位富人邀请他为自己生病的孩子讲故事, 希望自己的孩子能在人生的最后一刻打来一些勇气.约卡尔也不负众望, 最终这名可爱的孩子也在微笑中走完了自己的旅途.整个家庭喜极而泣与约卡尔拥抱在一起, 感谢他为自己亡故的孩子带来了最后的快乐.约卡尔希望能够将自己的故事与世间分享.他离开了家人四处旅游.";
